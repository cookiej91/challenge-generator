# Challenge Generator

This is a Challenge Generator For Binding Of Isaac - Afterbirth+.

Try it out here:
[Binding of Isaac - Challenge Generator](https://josh-cook.github.io/challenge-generator/)

A daily seed is automatically generated based on the days current date.
If a different seed is needed there is the ability to generate a new seed which will refresh upon generation.

There is also the ability to share the seed by copying it to clipboard and pasting wherever necessary.
